What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Whenever we initialize a git repository, we can track all the changes that are made in that repository.
Using git log we can see the commit history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area acts as an intermediary.It can have one or more file/s.Whichever files are added together in the staging
area are saved as a single commit in the working directory.
